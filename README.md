### Informatics Skills

Dual student of computer science (Bachelor) from fall 2025 until probably fall 2028 and with this later on probably software engineer - but so far, I'm just a regular everyday normal programmer and amateur scientist with a background in graphic design, illustration and animation based in Berlin.

**(+++)** Use of Adobe Creative Cloud programs (especially Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign, Animate, After Effects, Xd, Bridge, Dimension), operation of drum machines and synthesizers from the KORG product range;\
**(++)** Python3, Visual Studio Code, CLIs, UX / UI design, HTML5 and CSS3 web design, social networks, cyber security and IT forensics in theory, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux;\
**(+)** So far only beginner's knowledge of these programming and query languages: JavaScript, SQL, MySQL;

In programming, I'm syntactically and algorithmically most advanced in Python3 - here I have learned mainly about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, unit tests, file I/O, regular expressions, object-oriented programming, etc. within multiple online courses;

### Particularly known for...

...solving the MissingNo. riddle in the Pokémon versions Red and Blue for the Nintendo Game Boy. The Pokémon No. 000 (MissingNo.) was inspired by medical sonography during a pneumothorax examination, as there is the so-called Seashore-Sign in M-Mode in normal findings; [See hobby scientific article for my findings (written in German)](https://cranjah-hobbyist-research.myportfolio.com/the-missingno-mystery)
