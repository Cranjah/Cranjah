### Informatics Skills

Dual student of computer science (Bachelor) from fall 2025 until probably fall 2028 and with this later on hopefully software engineer - but so far, I'm just a regular casual everyday normal programmer and amateur scientist with a background in graphic design, illustration and animation based in Berlin.

**(+++)** Use of Adobe Creative Cloud programs (especially Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Dimension, Xd, Bridge), operation of drum machines and synthesizers from the KORG product range;\
**(++)** Python3, Visual Studio Code, CLIs, UX / UI design, HTML5 and CSS3 web design, social networks, cyber security and IT forensics in theory, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux;\
**(+)** So far only beginner's knowledge of these programming and query languages: C, JavaScript, SQL, MySQL;

In programming, I'm syntactically and algorithmically most advanced in Python3 - here I have learned mainly about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, unit tests, file I/O, regular expressions, object-oriented programming, etc. within multiple online courses;

Propositional logic, sets, Venn diagrams, de Morgan formulas, number sets N, Z and Q, arithmetic rules, decimal fractions, divisibility;

**Real numbers, elementary arithmetic and simple equations**\
Powers and roots, special features of √2 and π - number set R, sums with ∑ (sigma) and products with ∏ (pi), fundamentals of the induction principle, binomial formulas, linear and quadratic equations, rule of three;

**Sequences, series and limits**\
Asymptotic behavior, convergence and divergence of limits towards zero and infinity, arithmetic series, recursively defined sequences like the faculty function, the Fibonacci sequence and the Euclidean algorithm;

**Probability theory**\
Binomial coefficient and Pascal's triangle, fundamentals of combinatorics and probability, Laplace formula, Bernoulli distribution, relative frequency;

**And many more - I'm constantly learning new things in math**\

...solving the MissingNo. riddle in the Pokémon versions Red and Blue for the Nintendo Game Boy. The Pokémon No. 000 (MissingNo.) was inspired by medical sonography during a pneumothorax examination, as there is the so-called Seashore-Sign in M-Mode in normal findings; [See hobby scientific article for my findings (written in German)](https://cranjah-hobbyist-research.myportfolio.com/the-missingno-mystery)
