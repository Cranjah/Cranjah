### Informatics Skills

Dual student of computer science (Bachelor) from fall 2025 until probably fall 2028 and with this later on probably software engineer - but so far, I'm just a regular everyday normal programmer and amateur scientist with a background in graphic design, illustration and animation based in Berlin.

**(+++)** Use of Adobe Creative Cloud programs (especially Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign,Animate, After Effects, Xd, Bridge, Dimension), operation of drum machines and synthesizers from the KORG product range;\
**(++)** Visual Studio Code, CLIs, UX / UI design, HTML5 and CSS3 web design, social networks, cyber security and IT forensics in theory, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux;\
**(+)** So far only beginner's knowledge of programming and query languages: JavaScript, SQL, MySQL, Python;

In programming, I am syntactically and algorithmically most advanced in Python3 - here I have learned mainly about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, unit tests, file I/O, regular expressions, object-oriented programming, etc. within multiple online courses;


### Mathematics Skills

**Elementary set theory and number ranges**\
Propositional logic, sets, Venn diagrams, de Morgan formulas, number sets N, Z and Q, arithmetic rules, decimal fractions, divisibility;

**Real numbers, elementary arithmetic and simple equations**\
Powers and roots, special features of √2 and π - number set R, sums with ∑ (sigma) and products with ∏ (pi), induction principle, Pascal's triangle, binomial formulas, linear and quadratic equations, rule of three;

**Sequences, series and limits**\
Asymptotic behavior, convergence and divergence of limits towards zero and infinity, recursively defined sequences, arithmetic series;

**Probability theory**\
Binomial coefficient, combinatorics, probability, Laplace formula, Bernoulli distribution;

**And many more - I'm constantly learning new things in math**\
Fundamentals of functions and elementary functions, integrals, main theorem of differential and integral calculus, explicit solving of linear systems of equations and quadratic equations, basic geometry and formulas;
